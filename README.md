# SPEIT-Openaccess
This repository contains the digital versions of the textbooks and resources used in SPEIT's fundamental cycle(ou cycle fondamental/pr√©paratoire), since I don't expect everyone to be good and straight when it comes to purchasing the published version, feel free to reference the digital ones here.

Bear in mind three things:<br>
1.The digital versions are for reference ONLY, some of them are old and may or may not be the same as the published version. Also, this isn't pirating since for many of the courses in the SPEIT curriculum there isn't(yet) a published version. I recommend buying the paper version if you want up to date corrections.<br>
2.What's written on there doesn't necessarily correspond to the contents of the courses, sometimes adjustments are made by the teacher.<br>
3.Don't attempt to learn by yourself with only the textbook, unless your're a genius(but then you won't need the books anyway).Listen to the profs, they'll present the course better than a sole textbook.

No luck for the exercises though, you'll have to tackle these on your own!
<br>Maybe I'll try to write some of them for reference......?

**Update Notes**
* I believe there is a new course called "Introduction to Engineering" for Y1, not included in here since I never took it.
* Update 2024.10.6: Added the textbooks of the third semester. The linear algebra book is an older version but actually works better since the links in the TDM work. A more recent version exists but I refuse to use latex documents w/o links in them.
