# SPEIT-Openaccess
Some teaching materials, slides and texts

This repository contains the digital versions of the textbooks and resources used in SPEIT's fundamental cycle(ou cycle fondamental/pr√©paratoire), since I don't expect everyone to be good and straight when it comes to purchasing the published version, feel free to reference the digital ones here.

Bear in mind two things:
1.The digital versions are for reference ONLY, some of them are old and may or may not be the same as the published version. Also, this isn't pirating since for many of the courses in the SPEIT curriculum there isn't(yet) a published version.
2.What's written on there doesn't necessarily correspond to the contents of the courses, sometimes adjustments are made by the teacher.

Well, good luck!
